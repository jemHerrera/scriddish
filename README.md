Scriddish is a single-page front-end application made using Vue. The objective of the project is to create a beautiful and user-friendly mock app for meal and grocery planning. The app includes a wide variety of recipes that users can add to a meal plan. For every recipe added to the meal plan, the app generates a sorted grocery list for easy shopping. Recipes also include sets of instructions to follow while cooking. Front-end features include:

- Search function
- Sorted categories navigation scroll (similar to skip the dishes)
