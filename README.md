# scriddish

Scriddish is a single-page front-end app made using Vue3. The aim of the project is to create a beautiful and user-friendly mock app for meal planning and grocery listing. The app includes a variety of recipes that users can view and follow, as well as add to a meal plan. For every recipe added to the meal plan, the app auto-generates a sorted grocery list for ease of grocery shopping. Front-end features include:

- Search function
- Sorted categories navigation scroll (similar to skip the dishes)
- Add ingredient feature
- Use of cookies to retain meal plan for a few days
