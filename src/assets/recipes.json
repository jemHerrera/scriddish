            "Heat oven to 275° Fahrenheit (135C)",
            "If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it",
            "Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt, pepper or any rub of choice. Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet.",
            "Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then bake until the meat is tender or falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours.",
            "Remove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce of choice (optional).",
            "Optional: Move an oven rack near the top of the oven. Turn broiler to high and broil the ribs for 3-4 minutes, just until the barbecue sauce begins to caramelize. (Keep a close eye on the ribs while they broil so the sauce does not burn.)"
