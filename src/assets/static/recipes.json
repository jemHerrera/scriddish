Trim, then halve snap peas. Cut bok choy into 1-inch pieces. Thinly slice green onions. Peel, then mince or grate ginger.",
            "Add the rice and coconut milk to pot with boiling water (NOTE: Keep your eye on the pot so it doesn't boil over). Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 12-14 min.",

Transfer meatballs to a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in the middle of the oven, until golden-brown and cooked through, 12-14 min.**",

Cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 1-2 min. Add bok choy and remaining ginger. Cook, stirring often, until tender-crisp, 2-3 min. Season with salt and pepper. Remove pan from the heat, then transfer veggies to a plate and cover to keep warm.",
            "While veggies cook, whisk together hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sweet chili sauce, cornstarch and 3/4 cups water (dbl for 4 ppl) in another medium bowl. When veggies are done, heat the same pan over medium heat. When hot, add hoisin mixture and cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened, 2-3 min. Add meatballs to pan with sauce, toss to coat.",
            "Fluff coconut rice with a fork. Stir in half the green onions and season with salt. Divide rice among plates. Top with veggies, meatballs and sauce from the pan. Sprinkle with remaining green onions."
